## Introduction

The purpose of the Content Templates repository is to provide an assortment of templates that can be modified and used in various markets or segments for digital signage. The repository is organized by folders each folder contains its own separate template named by market or subject matter. Specific information on modifying various elements of each template can be found within a readme.md inside each template folder.

Content Templates works in conjunction with [Rise Vision](http://www.risevision.com), the [digital signage management application](http://rva.risevision.com/) that runs on [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com).

At this time Chrome is the only browser that this project and Rise Vision supports.
